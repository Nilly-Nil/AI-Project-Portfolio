# Context Avatar — Applied R&D Project

## Overview
An applied research and development project exploring persistent context, identity continuity, and stateful interaction in avatar-based AI systems.

The Context Avatar is not a chatbot. It is a framework for maintaining conversational memory, role continuity, and behavioral coherence across sessions and interaction modes.

## Problem Addressed
Most AI assistants aggressively reset context, resulting in shallow, transactional interactions.

This project addresses a core industry gap: enabling AI systems to maintain identity, intent, and conversational grounding over time without sacrificing control, safety, or interpretability.

## Key Contributions
- Context persistence model for avatar-driven interaction
- Scene-based conversational control system
- Memory gating and relevance filtering
- Identity continuity mechanisms
- Interface between reasoning output and avatar behavior
- Foundational architecture for long-lived AI agents

## Architecture Summary
- Context engine decoupled from UI
- Scene and state graph for conversational flow
- Memory layers with relevance scoring
- Avatar control layer driven by semantic intent

## Relationship to Personal Assistant
Concepts developed in Context Avatar directly informed the conversational state management and scene control systems used in the Personal Assistant prototype, providing a research-backed foundation for commercial deployment.

## Technologies
- Python
- LLM orchestration
- State machines and graph-based flow control
- Semantic context modeling
- Avatar interaction frameworks

## Status
Active R&D project.  
Being developed as a strategic extension and product advancement pitch aligned with commercial avatar-based AI systems.

## Access
Design documentation and code available upon request.
